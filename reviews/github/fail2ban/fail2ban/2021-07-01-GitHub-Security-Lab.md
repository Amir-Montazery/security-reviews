### Summary

I audited Fail2Ban for vulnerabilities that could be triggered by either a remote or local attacker. I did not find any exploitable issues.

### Details

Fail2ban protects against brute force password-guessing attacks. In its default configuration, it protects OpenSSH, but it includes configurations for other applications such as asterisk, dropbear, and mysql, that are very easy to enable. I have tested and audited the source code of Fail2ban for security vulnerabilities and did not find any serious issues. Fail2ban has a [known problem](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Possibility_of_DOS_attack_by_a_local_user) that an unprivileged local user can lock other users out of the system, which may make Fail2ban unsuitable for use on some shared servers. I also found that Fail2banâ€™s defenses against command injection attacks from a local attacker are not as good as they could be, because they rely on regexes in config files rather than validation in the source code, but I did not find anything that is exploitable in practice.

### Methodology

* Attack surface analysis
* Manual testing of attack surface
* Manual audit of security-sensitive areas of the source code

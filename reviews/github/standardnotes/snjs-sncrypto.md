### Summary

From March 2 through March 6, 2020, Standard Notes engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of SNJS and SNCrypto. Trail of Bits conducted this assessment for one person-week with two engineers working from commit b9d7b79 on branch 004 from the standardnotes/snjs repository, along with commit 0059a66 on branch 004 of the standardnotes/sncrypto repository.

### Details

The manual review of the codebase revealed four findings. Trail of Bits reported one medium-severity issue, TOB-SNOTES-001, related to insecure passwords. The remaining three, TOB-SNOTES-002â€“TOB-SNOTES-004, are informational findings related to values leaked to timing side-channels, and values not being cleared after they are no longer needed.

### Methodology

No methodology was provided.

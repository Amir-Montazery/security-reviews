### Summary

Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is thrilled to report the results of a security audit of CRI-O. CRI-O is an open source software (OSS) project that is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface. It can run any OCI-compatible container, providing an enormous number of applications and environments. 

The primary security finding of the work is a single high-severity issue. A few minor issues were found as well, however, the Audit Teamâ€™s view from completing this engagement is that CRI-O is a well-written project that has a high level of security assurance.

### Details

The high severity finding is a denial of service attack on a given cluster by way of resource exhaustion of nodes. The attack is performed by way of pod creation, which means any user that can create a pod can cause denial of service on the given node that is used for pod creation. The CVE for the this vulnerability is CVE-2022-1708 and Github advisory can be found here: https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j

Interestingly, the denial of service attack also occurred in other container runtime interface implementations, most notably Containerd. Specifically, the exact same attack that exhausts memory in CRI-O can be used to exhaust memory of Containerd. The CVE for this issue in containerd is CVE-2022-31030 and the Github security advisory can be found here: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf 

Furthermore, an extensive fuzzing suite targeting the CRI-O infrastructure was integrated as a result of this engagement, providing long-lasting improvements to the security posture of the project.

### Methodology

OSTIF undergoes an intensive scoping and RfP process to find the best-suited teams and individuals capable of performing high quality audit reviews.
